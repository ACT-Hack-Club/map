# Hack Club Clubs Map

This is a fully static site so to run simply download and run a server. Personally I like live-server.

Club map data is pulled from our Airtable bases.

Using [uhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml) for rendering and a custom helper to make web-components. Helper can be found in "makeComponent.js". Example usage of helper is in "club-map.js". If you're interested in contributing reach out ot @leo on Slack or just get it.
